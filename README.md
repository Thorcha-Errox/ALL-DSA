# ALL-DSA: Data Structures & Algorithms Roadmap

Welcome to my central repository for all things DSA. This project serves as a comprehensive log of my progress across various competitive programming platforms. It is a reflection of my problem-solving skills, consistency, and commitment to mastering algorithmic challenges.


## 📌 Project Overview
This repository is a curated collection of solutions to problems I have tackled on platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and **Coding Ninjas**. My goal is to build a robust understanding of computer science fundamentals and optimize my approach to complex problem-solving.

### 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized by platform to ensure easy navigation and scalability:

* **`Leetcode/`**: Daily challenges and topic-specific problems (Easy, Medium, Hard).
* **`GFG/`**: Solutions to problems from the GeeksforGeeks practice portal.
* **`Code360/`**: Challenges completed via Coding Ninjas (formerly Studio).
* **`My Own/`**: Personal implementations of standard algorithms, boilerplate code, and custom notes.

## 🛠️ Technical Focus
I focus on writing clean, efficient code with a primary emphasis on optimizing **Time and Space Complexity**.


## 📈 My Progress
- **Status:** Active (Daily Updates) 🟢
- **Primary Language:** [C++]
- **Total Solved:** [150]+ Problems
